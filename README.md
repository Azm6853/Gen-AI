# 💬 Sentio: Emotionally Intelligent AI Therapist

**Sentio** is an AI-powered emotional support agent designed to understand human emotions **through text-based tone and response patterns**. It offers conversational support for individuals experiencing loneliness, sadness, anxiety, or emotional overwhelm — using nuanced tone detection, empathetic dialogue, and adaptive responses based on user interaction style.

> “Sentio” means *“I feel”* in Latin — because real support begins with understanding.

## 🧠 Project Goal

To build a therapeutic AI companion that:

* Detects emotional tone from typing behavior and linguistic patterns
* Adapts its replies in real-time using empathy-driven prompts
* Tracks emotional state trends while preserving user privacy
* Offers coping tools like journaling prompts, breathing guides, and validation

---

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Tone-Aware Chat**: Understands emotions like sadness, anger, sarcasm, or fear through text cues (e.g., fragmented replies, lowercase typing, ellipses).
* **Empathetic Response Engine**: Adapts tone and language to match the user’s emotional state.
* **Emotional Drift Memory**: Tracks how the user’s emotional tone shifts over time — with optional long-term memory for continuity.
* **Safe-Mode Interventions**: Gently detects signs of emotional distress and offers escalation (e.g., “Would you like help connecting with a human?”).
* **No-Therapist Masking**: Clearly communicates that Sentio is a supportive AI, not a licensed mental health provider.

## 🧪 Example Interaction

```
User: i dunno. i just feel numb lately…
[Tone: withdrawn, flat, lowercase]

Sentio: That numbness… it’s heavy, isn’t it? You don’t have to explain everything. I'm here to sit with you in this moment. Would talking about what led here help?
```

```
User: haha. no worries. everything’s great :)
[Tone: masking, sarcasm]

Sentio: Sometimes we smile while carrying a lot inside. You don’t have to say more unless you want to — but I’m listening if you do.
```
